# Globear-frontend

A ClojureScript image viewer application based on Mapbox GL JS and Reagent.
This application is intended as travel-blog/photo album/foodie-guide, 
which should make it fun to organize your travel snapshots from all around the world.
Not sure yet what will come out in the end, but it surely will be 'beartastic' ;)

## Usage

The application is using `figwheel.main` for building and dependency management and serves the application by default under port `9500`. Without connection to the Globear-backend server, this will only display an empty map. The application will try to connect to the Globear-backend on startup and request the geo-marker definitions from `http://localhost:3000/markers`. 

Clicking on a geo-marker will open a Popup and all additional resources attached to this geo-marker (thumbnails & images) will then be loaded from the backend server. 

Old version using `lein-figwheel` (deprecated!): \
~~Compile ClojureScript application ```lein cljsbuild auto dev```~~ \  
~~Run python server ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080```~~ \
~~Compile & run ClojureScript application ```lein figwheel```~~ \

New version using figwheel.main: \
Run dev application server with REPL: ```clojure -m figwheel.main --build dev --repl ``` \
Close REPL again :) ```:cljs/quit```

In order to run the application locally, you need to provide a Mapbox access token and custom map style to be able to call 
the Mapbox API. Inside the ```/globear/map/``` module, create a file called ```mapbox_config.cljs```
and add your access token to the file:

```clojure
(def token "[YOUR ACCESS TOKEN]")
```
Afterwards, exchange the configured mapbox style with your own: 
```clojure
 {:container "map" :style "[YOUR MAPBOX STYLE]" :center [-3.688495 40.399189], :zoom 13}
```

## TODO 
* ~~Introduce Totoro-themed markers to the map~~
* ~~Use core.async for client server communication handling?~~
* ~~Combine reagent state and picture downloads via core.async -> how does the 
  map state update when picture download is finished?~~
* ~~Come up with a reasonable data structure for markers and contained pictures~~
* ~~Introduce cluster markers~~
* feature: integrate 'food-guide' functionality
* feature: ~~set new geo-marker on the map~~ and upload additional pictures / content
* feature: add delete/update functionality to geo-markers
